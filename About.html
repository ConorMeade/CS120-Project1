                <p>Aja & Gaucho have been committed Steely Dan fans since birth. Aja's mother even claims to have played Steely 
                    Dan for Aja while he was in the womb. These best friends started their band at UMass Amherst as a party joke amongst friends who
                    liked to drink too much tequila, but soon gained a cult following on campus. Now, twenty years later the band still
                    gets together to share their art, talent, and love for Steely Dan to the masses for weddings, barbeques, and any gig
                    that is willing to pay them!
