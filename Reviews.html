                <li><span>A fantastic show that any Steely Dan fan would love!</span></li>
                <li><span>Hey Nineteen! Knowledgeable and skilled musicians that know to play the hits.</span></li>
                <li><span>Steely Dan never toured back in the day. This band perfectly recreates what a show would be like!</span></li>
                <li><span>Aja & Gaucho live up to the hype, I had a great time with the whole family!</span></li>
